## What's Different?

I wanted to really lean into what makes a piece of media, in this case a TTRPG, have that sense of dread and horror. For me, that's putting normal people in extraordinary situations without giving them extraordinary resources to overcome it. This ethos is heavily influenced by the video game "Amnesia: The Dark Descent."

For that reason I am making some drastic changes to the base idea of Cypher System. Which are as follows.

- Starting pools have generally been cut by 3 across Types.
- Starting additional pool points cut by 3.
- New Types.
- New Abilities.
- While standard Effort rules still apply (i.e. you may spend a number of levels of Effort per action equal to your Effort), it is also capped to Tier + 1 per scene. Meaning that a Tier 1 character may only use their Effort twice in a given scene.
- Any NPC woth the Monster descriptor cannot be killed, only Dazed and/or Trapped.
- You'll find that most of the outright comnat abilities have been removed or reduced in effectiveness.
- A new PANIC! level has been added to the PCs and Group.

## Goals

While Cypher System is fantastic for narrative first games, characters skew toward the more heoric side of gaming. Between their stat pools, abilities, skills, and cyphers they are particularly powerful. This can rob horror games of their tension.

I want to test the system, push it as close to the breaking point as possible, and see where we end up. I hope with the reduction in stat pools and Effort restriction we can make the mechanics diagetic to the themes.

# Mystery Gang Rules

Thematically we're going for horror + mystery + goofy hijinks. Think Scooby-Doo meets Brindlewood Bay. You'll see this show up in the new ability names and chase rules.

Here you'll find the four new Types, the allowed Foci, and new rules for PANIC! and Chases.

## New Types

There are four new types specifically designed for Mystery Gang. The original Types found in other books will most likely be too powerful for this game and I would not recommend using them. Unless you're looking to play a more heroic game.
