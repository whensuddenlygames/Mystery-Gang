## What's Different?

I wanted to really lean into what makes a piece of media, in this case a TTRPG, have that sense of dread and horror. For me, that's putting normal people in extraordinary situations without giving them extraordinary resources to overcome it. This ethos is heavily influenced by the video game "Amnesia: The Dark Descent."

For that reason I am making some drastic changes to the base idea of Cypher System. Which are as follows.

- Starting pools have generally been cut by 3 across Types.
- Starting additional pool points cut by 3.
- New Types.
- New Abilities.
- While standard Effort rules still apply (i.e. you may spend a number of levels of Effort per action equal to your Effort), it is also capped to Tier + 1 per scene. Meaning that a Tier 1 character may only use their Effort twice in a given scene.
- Any NPC woth the Monster descriptor cannot be killed, only Dazed and/or Trapped.
- You'll find that most of the outright comnat abilities have been removed or reduced in effectiveness.
- A new PANIC! level has been added to the PCs and Group.

## Goals

While Cypher System is fantastic for narrative first games, characters skew toward the more heoric side of gaming. Between their stat pools, abilities, skills, and cyphers they are particularly powerful. This can rob horror games of their tension.

I want to test the system, push it as close to the breaking point as possible, and see where we end up. I hope with the reduction in stat pools and Effort restriction we can make the mechanics diagetic to the themes.

# Mystery Gang Rules

Thematically we're going for horror + mystery + goofy hijinks. Think Scooby-Doo meets Brindlewood Bay. You'll see this show up in the new ability names and chase rules.

Here you'll find the four new Types, the allowed Foci, and new rules for PANIC! and Chases.

## New Types

There are four new types specifically designed for Mystery Gang. The original Types found in other books will most likely be too powerful for this game and I would not recommend using them. Unless you're looking to play a more heroic game.

### Trapper

| Stat       | Starting Pool |
| :--------  | :-------:  |
| Might      | 7          |
| Speed      | 7          |
| Intellect  | 5          |

You get 3 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish.

#### First-Tier Trapper
Trapper's have the following abilities

**Effort:** Effort of 1 

**Physical Nature:** Choose whether to start with a Might or Speed Edge of 1, set the other to 0. Your Intellect Edge is 0. 

**Cypher Use:** Can bear one Cypher at a time. 

**Weapons:** Practiced with light and improvised weapons of medium size.

**Starting Equipment:** Appropriate clothing and one light weapon of your choice, plus one expensive item, two moderately priced items, and up to four inexpensive items. 

**Special Abilities:** Choose four of the abilities listed below. You can't choose the same ability more than once unless its description says otherwise. The full description for each listed ability can be found in Abilities, which also has descriptions for flavor and focus abilities in a single vast catalog.

- Bash (1 Might point): This is a pummeling melee attack. Your attack inflicts 1 less point of damage than normal to human targets and dazes them for one round, during which time all tasks it performs are hindered. For monster targets this only dazes them. Action.
- Shove (1 Might point): This melee attack inflicts 1 less point of damage to human targets, and regardless of whether you hit the target, you maneuver it into a position you desire within immediate range. For monster targets this causes no damage nor dazes them. Action.
- Improved Edge: Choose one of your Edge stats that is 0. It increases to 1. Enabler.
- Overwatch (1 Intellect point): You use a ranged weapon to target a limited area (such as a doorway, a hallway, or the eastern side of the clearing) and make an attack against the next viable target to enter that area. This works like a wait action, but you also negate any benefit the target would have from cover, position, surprise, range, illumination, or visibility. Further, you inflict 1 additional point of damage or extra daze to monsters with the attack. You can remain on overwatch as long as you wish, within reason. Action.
- Physical Skills: You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler.
- Spring the Trap (1 Speed point): You spring the trap to catch your target. On human targets this action is eased by 1 step. Action.
- Quick Throw (2 Speed points): After using an improvised thrown light weapon, you draw another improvised light weapon and make another thrown attack against the same target or a different one. Action.
